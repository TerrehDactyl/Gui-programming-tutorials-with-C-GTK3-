The code snippets in this repository are all tutorials for C programming using the GTK3.0 library.
All of the code is compiled using gcc inputfilename.c -o outputfilename `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0`

What do I hope to accomplish?
-
I want new programmers to be able to easily create their own GUI applications. When learning this myself I felt that 
the content available for C programming using the GTK3.0 library was very lacking, as such, I feel that if I can help even
1 person to understand this material a little better, then my time has been compensated for.
